# Travel Tour Booking Website

This is a full-stack web application built using the **MERN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)**.  
The project aims to improve the **user experience in searching, comparing, and booking travel tours** by providing a centralized and intelligent platform.

## Project Objectives

### User Goals
Many users face difficulties when trying to find suitable tours due to:
- Scattered information across multiple platforms
- Lack of detailed filtering options
- Time-consuming communication with tour agencies

This website **centralizes tour information** and enables users to filter tours based on **destination, date, duration, and price**, allowing them to find the right tour quickly and effortlessly.

### Technical Goals
This project also serves as an opportunity to practice and apply full-stack web development skills using the MERN stack:
- Designing user interfaces with React.js
- Building RESTful APIs with Node.js & Express
- Managing and querying data using MongoDB
- Implementing user authentication with JWT
- Deploying the application in a real-world environment
